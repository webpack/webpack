Most of the time, if webpack is not working correctly for you it is a simple configuration issue.

If you are still having difficulty after looking over your configuration carefully, please post
a question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). Questions
that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files are more likely to receive responses.

**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.**

If you have created your own loader/plugin please include it on the relevant
documentation pages:

[List of loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html)
[List of plugins](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html)

### Documentation

webpack is insanely feature rich and documentation is a huge time sink. We
greatly appreciate any time spent fixing typos or clarifying sections in the
documentation.
