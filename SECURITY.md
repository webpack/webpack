# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in webpack, please report it by sending an
email to [webpack@opencollective.com](mailto:webpack@opencollective.com).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make webpack safe for everyone.

## Incident Response Plan

In the event of a security incident, please refer to the
[Security Incident Response Plan](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md).
