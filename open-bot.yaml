          It looks like this Pull Request doesn't include [enough test cases]({{status.target_url}}) (based on Code Coverage analysis of the PR diff).

          A PR need to be covered by tests if you add a new feature (we want to make sure that your feature is working) or if you fix a bug (we want to make sure that we don't run into a regression in future).

          @{{issue.user.login}} Please check if this is appliable to your PR and if you can add more test cases.

          Read the [test readme](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/test/README.md) for details how to write test cases.

          Hi @{{pull_request.user.login}}.

          Just a little hint from a friendly bot about the best practice when submitting pull requests:

          > Don't submit pull request from your own `main` branch. It's recommended to create a feature branch for the PR.

          *You don't have to change it for this PR, just make sure to follow this hint the next time you submit a PR.*
