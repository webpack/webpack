        @{{issue.user.login}} The most important CI builds failed. This way your PR can't be merged.

        Please take a look at the CI results from [travis]({{status_1.target_url}}) ({{status_1.state}}) and [appveyor]({{status_2.target_url}}) ({{status_2.state}}) and fix these issues.

        It looks like this Pull Request doesn't include [enough test cases]({{status.target_url}}) (based on Code Coverage analysis of the PR diff).

        A PR need to be covered by tests if you add a new feature (we want to make sure that your feature is working) or if you fix a bug (we want to make sure that we don't run into a regression in future).

        @{{issue.user.login}} Please check if this is appliable to your PR and if you can add more test cases.

        Read the [test readme](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/test/README.md) for details how to write test cases.

        Hi @{{pull_request.user.login}}.

        Just a little hint from a friendly bot about the best practice when submitting pull requests:

        > Don't submit pull request from your own `master` branch. It's recommended to create a feature branch for the PR.

        *You don't have to change it for this PR, just make sure to follow this hint the next time you submit a PR.*
