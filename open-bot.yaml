        It looks like this Pull Request doesn't include [enough test cases]({{status.html_url}}).
        
        @{{issue.user.login}} Please add more test cases.
        
        See [test readme](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/test/README.md) for details how to write test cases.
