**What is the current behavior?**


**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**


<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repo. -->
<!-- Best provide a minimal reproduceable repo with instructions -->
<!-- Repos with too many files or long configs are not suitable -->
<!-- Please only add small snippets of code directly into the issue -->
<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->
<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader file the issue on the plugin/loader repo instead. -->

**What is the expected behavior?**


<!-- "It should work" is not a good explaination -->
<!-- Explain how exactly you expecting it to behave -->
